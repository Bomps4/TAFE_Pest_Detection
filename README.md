This is the repository for the code used in the paper "Accelerating Image-based Pest Detection on a Heterogeneous Multi-core Microcontroller". All the code in this repo is considered distributed under the BSD licence included in this same repo with the exception of the code in the Viola-Jones repos which is considered under the MIT licence.  

The code in this repository requires for you to have the gap_sdk installed on your machine. 

The  code in the gap 8 folder requires this [gap_sdk](https://github.com/GreenWaves-Technologies/gap_sdk), we used the 4.12 version.

Following the instructions provided in the repo, you may install the SDK.

Once you have installed it, run 
```
source path/to/your/gap_sdk/sourceme.sh
```

selecting gap8_v3 .

Instead, the code in the gap 9 folder requires this [gap_sdk](https://github.com/GreenWaves-Technologies/gap_sdk_private) with tag release-v5.4.0. You may need to request access to this sdk. 

following the instructions provided in the repo, you may install the SDK.

Once you have installed it run 

```
source path/to/your/gap_sdk/sourceme.sh
```

selecting gap9_EVK_board

You are now ready to run the code in the directory of your choice.
